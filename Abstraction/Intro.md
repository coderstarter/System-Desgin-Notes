# Abstraction in Computer Science

## Overview
Abstraction is the art of obfuscating details that are unnecessary for the current focus, allowing us to concentrate on the big picture. This broader view hides inner complexities, providing a clearer understanding of goals and maintaining focus. 

## Example
### Abstraction of a Bird
- **Illustration**: General representation of birds without specific details.
- **Purpose**: Recognize all birds broadly rather than specific types.

## Computer Science Context
In computer science, abstraction allows users and developers to:
- Utilize computers without needing to build hardware or operating systems from scratch.
- Develop large systems using libraries without delving into their internal implementation.

### Libraries as Abstraction
- **Purpose**: Provide an easy interface to use functions.
- **Benefit**: Reusable in multiple projects with similar needs.

## Database Abstraction
- **Transactions**: A database abstraction handling concurrent user data operations.
- **Interface**: Simplifies actions into commit (success) or abort (failure).
- **Benefit**: Users focus on business logic rather than concurrent data mutation complexities.

## Abstractions in Distributed Systems
Abstractions simplify engineers' work in distributed systems, hiding the underlying complexity.

### Benefits in Distributed Systems
- **Provided by**: Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, etc.
- **Purpose**: Allow developers to focus on applications, not the complex implementation of distributed services.
- **Need**: Modern applications require distributed systems to remain responsive and functional due to growing user numbers.

### Usage
- Abstractions facilitate quick shifts to distributed systems for scaling applications.
- Core ideas are conveyed without delving into all subtleties.
