# Introduction to Building Blocks for Modern System Design

## Overview
System design in modern software development is like using Lego pieces to build complex structures. By understanding fundamental components—building blocks—we can efficiently design scalable systems.

## The Bottom-Up Approach
- **Modular Design**: Design once, reuse everywhere.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time and effort.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale systems by modifying or adding building blocks.

## Key Building Blocks

### 1. **Domain Name System (DNS)**
   - **Purpose**: Hierarchical and distributed naming for computers.
   - **Key Concepts**: DNS hierarchy, resolution, caching.

### 2. **Load Balancers**
   - **Purpose**: Distribute incoming requests among servers.
   - **Key Concepts**: Round-robin, least connections, health checks, failover.

### 3. **Databases**
   - **Purpose**: Store, retrieve, modify, delete data.
   - **Key Concepts**: SQL, NoSQL, replication, partitioning, distributed databases.

### 4. **Key-Value Store**
   - **Purpose**: Non-relational database for key-value pairs.
   - **Key Concepts**: Scalability, durability, configurability.

### 5. **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - **Purpose**: Efficiently deliver content to end users.
   - **Key Concepts**: Caching, edge servers, content replication.

### 6. **Sequencer**
   - **Purpose**: Generate unique IDs maintaining causality.
   - **Key Concepts**: Centralized, distributed, time-based sequencers.

### 7. **Service Monitoring**
   - **Purpose**: Monitor performance and alert stakeholders.
   - **Key Concepts**: Server-side, client-side monitoring, alerting, logging.

### 8. **Distributed Caching**
   - **Purpose**: Coordinate multiple cache servers.
   - **Key Concepts**: Cache invalidation, coherence, consistency.

### 9. **Distributed Messaging Queue**
   - **Purpose**: Decouple producers and consumers.
   - **Key Concepts**: Message brokering, queue management, reliability.

### 10. **Publish-Subscribe System**
   - **Purpose**: Asynchronous communication in microservices.
   - **Key Concepts**: Topics, subscriptions, event handling.

### 11. **Rate Limiter**
   - **Purpose**: Throttle incoming service requests.
   - **Key Concepts**: Token bucket, leaky bucket, fixed window.

### 12. **Blob Store**
   - **Purpose**: Store unstructured data like multimedia files.
   - **Key Concepts**: Data durability, accessibility, scalability.

### 13. **Distributed Search**
   - **Purpose**: Process queries and return relevant content.
   - **Key Concepts**: Crawling, indexing, searching.

### 14. **Distributed Logging**
   - **Purpose**: Log events in a distributed system.
   - **Key Concepts**: Log aggregation, durability, indexing.

### 15. **Distributed Task Scheduling**
   - **Purpose**: Allocate resources to tasks intelligently.
   - **Key Concepts**: Task prioritization, resource allocation, fault tolerance.

### 16. **Sharded Counters**
   - **Purpose**: Manage concurrent read/write requests.
   - **Key Concepts**: Sharding, consistency, atomicity.

## Conventions
- **Functional Requirements**: User-facing features.
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**: Usability criteria like high availability, low latency, scalability.

## Conclusion
Using building blocks allows for a modular, bottom-up strategy in system design. This ensures efficient, scalable, and maintainable systems.
